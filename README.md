### Owlet Windy Plugin
Owlet wants to repurpose orphaned oil wells in Alberta into Advanced Adiabatic - Compressed Air Energy Storage (AA-CAES). This plugin uses current wind speeds to estimate the energy available if a 4.2 MW wind turbine was installed at each site. Using the Vestas V150-4.2 power curve characteristics, the wind speed at 100 m elevation is interpolated, and the wind generation estimated. Each site marker is colour coded based on the power generated vs. capacity.

This data is intended to be used to compare to Alberta energy demand and generation, and to demonstrate the viability of using the orphaned wells as AA-CAES, with a full charge consuming 2.9 MWh, returning 2 MWh per site.
